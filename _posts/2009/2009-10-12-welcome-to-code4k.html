A blog tentative about coding intros for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demoscene</a>. When ulrick came to me in 2007 and proposed me to come back to the demoscene and join FRequency, I told him "no way, I'm too old for that now!"... :)<br /><br />After more than 15 years away from the scene, I found this come back to be somewhat difficult... and well, challenging...so I accepted his proposal, apart the fact that it is much more difficult to spent several hours in programming when your family is expecting to go outside for a walk compared to the "easy student life" when I was coding demos on Amiga!<br /><br />Thanks to xt95, a talented young coder from FRequency, we were able to release quite a <a href="http://www.frequency.fr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=70">few nice prods</a>. I spent mainly my time developing some "backoffice" tools and worked on the coding/design of some of the demos, and spent (and still spending!) a lot of time to understand the new technical jargon, playing a bit with opengl or directx. Well, I have to admit that it's a huge investment to catch up the real-time graphics/sound coding domain, as i used to work for almost 10 years in a domain not really related to it. I just hope to release an intro on my own in 2010!<br /><br />One thing is that i'm discovering and learning things everyday, and this is very cool. One other thing is that I want to share this with others, and this is the reason why I opened this blog. Hope that I'll be able to keep it updated! ;)<br /><br />@lx
