What would it take these days to build a prototype of a new language and operating system built on top of it, just for fun? 

Incidentally, during the 2018 winter holidays, while playing with a RaspberryPI3B+

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Woot! I just hacked the &quot;Building an Operating System for the Raspberry Pi&quot; <a href="https://t.co/tSvS8Bz0ft">https://t.co/tSvS8Bz0ft</a> by writing the kernel in C# and using the AOT Compiler with a slightly modified version of CoreRT to compile it to ARM, and... it&#39;s running!

This brought me back to my teenager time when I had so much fun running assembly code directly on Amstrad/Amiga computers without using an OS... time has passed, and as I was also re-reading all the fascinating [collection of blog posts of Joe Duffy about Midori](http://joeduffyblog.com/2015/11/03/blogging-about-midori/) and also discovered through some discussions on Twitter that Google has been actually working on a [new OS called Fuchsia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fuchsia) with its micro-kernel [Zircon](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon), it made me realized how much I would like to reinvestigate these areas...

So one year ago, I decided to re-focus the work on [the stark programming language experiment](http://xoofx.com/blog/2017/01/17/the-stark-programming-language-experiment/) and to extend its goal by building, not only a safe and efficient system programming language, but also a fast, secure and lightweight micro-kernel and capability based operating system, IoT and cloud ready (game OS also, why not?), async/await event/driven based, but also built with data oriented techniques... 

I believe that there are still large and exciting areas to explore and challenge in this domain, as much as I'm eager to be technically challenged, learn and share from this experiment!

Though while I have been enjoying the early design/prototyping of stark, It became also obvious that starting entirely from scratch a whole compiler would not allow me to make enough sustainable progress and to keep enough motivation during my spare-time on the long run... 

But in this era of OSS goodness, we can rely on the shoulders of existing giants to experiment and prototype more quickly what would have been impossible in the past... So during the past year, with the help of the .NET ecosystem and the [seL4 micro-kernel](http://sel4.systems/), I have built a vertical prototype of the language, its core library, its front-end compiler, a native compiler and an embryo-integration with seL4:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Finally, here is a capture of the boot sequence of a HelloWorld program with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/starklang?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#starklang</a> on top of the seL4 micro-kernel. <br>This marks the end of the 1st vertical prototype by bringing up together a front-end compiler, native compiler and micro-kernel integration! ‚ù§Ô∏è <a href="https://t.co/kEQ2esGHj4">pic.twitter.com/kEQ2esGHj4</a></p>&mdash; Alexandre Mutel (@xoofx) <a href="https://twitter.com/xoofx/status/1226962715656278022?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Though, apart [sharing my progess on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23starklang&src=typed_query&f=live), I haven't taken the time so far to explain what this is all about... So before continuing further this experiment, It is time for me to share more about this project in a proper blog post, and more specifically:

- Give more details about the "why?" of this project
- How was built this first milestone prototype?
- Where is it going?

## Foundations

### Stark - The language

I have realized that I never took the time to write down the requirements and goals of this language. They might have changed slightly since I wrote ["Going Native 2.0, The future of WinRT"](https://xoofx.com/blog/2012/08/08/going-native-20-future-of-winrt/) or more recently about [stark](https://xoofx.com/blog/2017/01/17/the-stark-programming-language-experiment/), but in the end, they are tactical tradeoffs between the 3 following pillars:

- [Safe](#safe)
- [Efficient](#efficient)
- [Productive](#productive)

#### Safe

As a programmer, this language should help me to:

            <ul>
                <li>Detect at compile time contracts on e.g method arguments that would not be fullfil.</li>
                <li>Otherwise run these contracts at runtime which could lead to a program abort.</li>
            </ul>

      <tr>
         <td>Allow unsafe (in the safe section? Are you crazy?)</td>
         <td>
            <ul>
                <li>Only via explicit unsafe in the code and by enabling it via a compiler command line switch.</li>
