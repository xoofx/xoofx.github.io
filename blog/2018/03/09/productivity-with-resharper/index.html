    </div>
      <p>I have been using ReSharper for around 10 years now and it has been my number one productivity tool when developing in C#. When Visual Studio 2015 switched to Roslyn I was very annoyed by the massive slow down occurring when using ReSharper and Roslyn together on large solutions. Things have been improving, but still using ReSharper feels more and more heavy with Roslyn and I'm sometimes annoyed by the UI freezes that can happen, when loading a big solution or after working several hours on a project. Simply looking at the task manager shows that when ReSharper is on, the memory is going very high. But there are reasons for that - caching useful data...</p>
<p>So for a few days this week, I tried to disable ReSharper (only in VS2017, I kept it for my day work VS2015 instance)... and the result is that... <strong>Roslyn is not yet anywhere near to the experience of ReSharper</strong>, I'm loosing too much productivity compare to the more lightweight - on all aspects - Roslyn VS experience I'm getting...</p>
<p>I have selected in this post a few examples on two very common usages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smart completion</li>
<li>Code navigation</li>
</ul>
<p>My apologize If I'm not covering all the methods for completion or navigation or even all the other features provided by ReSharper. ReSharper typically comes with a lot more features than what is described here... but by looking at the very minimal experience here that you get, I can firmly say that <strong>ReSharper still provides the best coding experience</strong> and I'm ready to pay the extra money, RAM and the few GC cycles lost into UI slowdown during a coding day If it can improve dramatically my overall productivity.</p>
<h1 id="smart-completion">Smart Completion</h1>
<p>The smart completion in ReSharper is way beyond what we have with Roslyn, mainly on two aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>ReSharper is providing a <strong>true context sensitive and smart completion</strong>, taking into account the context (and I believe things also like what you have used mostly recently...etc.). It is maintaining a cache of every symbols in your project and these symbols are carefully selected and used to popup in your code as soon as you type:
<ul>
<li>Common types and idioms</li>
<li>Relevant constructors</li>
<li>Static method factory are coming to create an instance when no constructor are available</li>
<li>...etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ReSharper allows to type <strong>very few keystrokes</strong> to get this done</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's see how it works with a few selected example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type completion</li>
<li>Method call completion</li>
<li>Delegate completion</li>
<li>Static variable completion</li>
</ul>
<p>And yet, I have just selected a few cases here...</p>
<h2 id="type-completion">Type completion</h2>
<p>In an empty file, we simply want to access <code>System.Collection.Generics.List&lt;T&gt;</code>, so we naturally start to type <code>List</code>:</p>

<td><img src="/images/2018-03-09-productivity-with-resharper/case1-smart-completion-type-resharper.png" alt="case1-smart-completion-type-resharper" />  In this first step, we can already see that ReSharper is providing the right type out-of-the-box just after typing the first letter <code>L</code>!. Not only it provides a list of everything that could be accessed even outside of your namespace our class (including static fields, properties, methods, types) but also it weights the usage by providing the most common completion (and <code>List</code> is a super common usage)</td>
<td><img src="/images/2018-03-09-productivity-with-resharper/case1-smart-completion-type-roslyn.png" alt="case1-smart-completion-type-roslyn" /> Here Roslyn doesn't provide anything useful for our case</td>

What we don't see in this screenshot is that after typing <code>List</code> you have the feeling to wait more than 1s for the namespace import tooltip to appear, which is way too long...</td>

<p>As we can see we have to type - and wait! - a lot more when typing with Roslyn and I'm having this typing situation hundreds of times per day!</p>

<p>Code navigation is another aspect where ReSharper is still leading by providing many useful and well presented navigation methods and popups.</p>

<h2 id="type-inheritance">Type Inheritance</h2>
<ul>
<li>In ReSharper just hit <code>&lt;ALT&gt;+&lt;END&gt;</code> on the inherited type</li>
<li>In Roslyn just hit <code>&lt;CTRL&gt;+&lt;F12&gt;</code></li>

Unlike ReSharper, the content is not focused on the screen, where I'm actually looking at. Also the super annoying thing about the selector is that it is using the code preview, so if you try to scroll down the types, it will start to open different files on the screen, while you absolutely don't want this (at least me) and unfortunately, you can't disable this by an obvious settings (frankly, I haven't tried to look further... the experience was already so unpleasant that I didn't have the courage to continue further)</td>

<h1 id="next">Next?</h1>
<p>I'm going to <strong>re-install ReSharper on my Visual Studio 2017 instance</strong>. Sure I could live with a stripped-down coding experience by using only Roslyn, but I can immediately feel the productivity loss and this is something I will not trade easily, unless ReSharper becomes really unusable at all (which is not the case).</p>
<p>While <strong>Roslyn</strong> have been certainly improving in the recent releases, I can't say that it can replace what ReSharper has been providing for years.</p>
<p>Still, as I mentioned around on my twitter feed two years ago about the slowdown of ReSharper, I strongly believe that ReSharper should have moved very early to adopt Roslyn as soon as possible, as part of a broader vision on the future of the product and its viability.</p>
