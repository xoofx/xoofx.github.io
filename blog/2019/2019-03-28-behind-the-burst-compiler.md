Last year I made a presentation to [Unite LA](https://unite.unity.com/2018/los-angeles), the [dotnetos conference](https://conf.dotnetos.org) in Warsaw and to the [dotnext conference](https://dotnext.ru/en/) in Moscow of the **burst compiler** that we have been working on for the past two years at Unity

> In a nutshell: 
> 
> The **burst compiler** is a technology aimed at unlocking performance for a subset of C# code beyond what C++ has been usually able to do, by translating .NET IL code into highly efficient native code.
