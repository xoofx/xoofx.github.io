I haven't been blogging for a while, and this post is not going to be a real blog post! But I wanted to share an old presentation I made a few years ago at my company about Comments in code, as I think that it is worth sharing beyond an inner circle.

The reason I made originally this presentation is that I started to realize that every time I was bringing the topic to some developers about commenting the code we write, I was often getting the same kind of objections, that were ultimately made to legitimate that, in the end, no comment at all are needed.

So, let me explain why this is so wrong and harmful.

Happy Coding... and Commenting! ðŸ¤—
