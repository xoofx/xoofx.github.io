In my spare time, I have developed a couple of open-source projects on [github](https://github.com/xoofx) and try to maintain them:

- [lunet](https://github.com/lunet-io/lunet) A fast and powerful static website generator written in C# (prototype, used for this website and [kalk](https://kalk.dev/))
- [kalk](https://github.com/xoofx/kalk) This is the repository of [kalk](https://kalk.dev/), a powerful command line calculator app for developers.
- [Blake3.NET](https://github.com/xoofx/Blake3.NET) Blake3.NET is a fast managed wrapper around the SIMD Rust implementations of the BLAKE3 cryptographic hash function.
- [LibObjectFile](https://github.com/xoofx/LibObjectFile) LibObjectFile is a .NET library to read, manipulate and write linker and executable object files (e.g ELF, ar, DWARF, COFF...)
- [CppAst.CodeGen](https://github.com/xoofx/CppAst.CodeGen) CppAst.CodeGen is an extensible P/Invoke Code Generator from C/C++ to C# for .NET relying on CppAst for parsing C/C++
- [CppAst.NET](https://github.com/xoofx/CppAst.NET) CppAst provides a C/C++ parser for header files with access to the full AST, comments and macros for .NET Framework and .NET Core
- [Monocypher.NET](https://github.com/xoofx/Monocypher.NET) Monocypher.NET is a managed wrapper around [Monocypher](https://github.com/LoupVaillant/Monocypher) cryptographic library.
- [JitBuddy](https://github.com/xoofx/JitBuddy) JitBuddy provides a small helper method to disassemble to a x86/x64 ASM listing the native code generated by the JIT of a managed method.
- [Broslyn](https://github.com/xoofx/Broslyn) A lightweight utility library to create a Roslyn AdhocWorkspace from an existing solution/csproj.
- [Tomlyn](https://github.com/xoofx/Tomlyn) Tomlyn is a TOML parser, validator and authoring library for .NET Framework and .NET Core
- [Zio](https://github.com/xoofx/zio) Zio provides a simple, powerful, cross-platform filesystem abstraction for .NET with many built-ins filesystems.
- [babelmark 3](https://babelmark.github.io/) A website that allows to compare various Markdown implementations (including Markdig!)
- [Markdig](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig) A Markdown processor for .NET, a fully extensible implementation of the [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) standard with excellent performance, both in terms of speed, and GC pressure.
- [NUglify](https://github.com/xoofx/NUglify) A HTML, JavaScript and CSS minification Library for .NET (fork of AjaxMin + new features)

- [SharpScss](https://github.com/xoofx/SharpScss) A pinvoke .NET wrapper around libsass to convert SCSS to CSS
- [GitRocketFilter](https://github.com/xoofx/GitRocketFilter) A super fast alternative to `git-filter-branch`, powerful command line tool to rewrite git branches powered by .NET, equivalent of
- [jsonite](https://github.com/xoofx/jsonite) Jsonite is a lightweight JSON serializer and deserializer for .NET
- [SharpDX](http://sharpdx.org) The definitive DirectX wrapper for .NET
- [SharpDoc](https://github.com/xoofx/SharpDoc) A documentation generator for .NET
- [SharpCLABot](https://github.com/SharpCLABot/SharpCLABot) An ASP.NET application providing CLA bot for github projects, hostable on Azure
- [SharpYaml](https://github.com/xoofx/SharpYaml/) A YAML parser (this is a fork)

- [NRenoiseTools](https://nrenoisetools.codeplex.com/) A Renoise file exporter to MIDI 

I have also contributed to some open source projects:

- [NAudio](https://naudio.codeplex.com/) A popular Audio framework for .NET
