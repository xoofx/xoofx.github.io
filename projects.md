In my spare time, I have developed a couple of open-source projects on [github](https://github.com/xoofx) and try to maintain them:

- [babelmark 3](https://babelmark.github.io/) A website that allows to compare various Markdown implementations (including Markdig!)
- [Markdig](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig) A Markdown processor for .NET, a fully extensible implementation of the [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) standard with excellent performance, both in terms of speed, and GC pressure.
- [NUglify](https://github.com/xoofx/NUglify) A HTML, JavaScript and CSS minification Library for .NET (fork of AjaxMin + new features)
- [Scriban](https://github.com/scriban/scriban) A fast, powerful and lightweight text templating language and engine for .NET 
- [SharpScss](https://github.com/xoofx/SharpScss) A pinvoke .NET wrapper around libsass to convert SCSS to CSS
- [GitRocketFilter](https://github.com/xoofx/GitRocketFilter) A super fast alternative to `git-filter-branch`, powerful command line tool to rewrite git branches powered by .NET, equivalent of
- [SharpDX](http://sharpdx.org) The definitive DirectX wrapper for .NET
- [SharpDoc](https://github.com/xoofx/SharpDoc) A documentation generator for .NET
- [SharpCLABot](https://github.com/SharpCLABot/SharpCLABot) An ASP.NET application providing CLA bot for github projects, hostable on Azure
- [SharpYaml](https://github.com/xoofx/SharpYaml/) A YAML parser (this is a fork)
- [SharpRazor](https://github.com/xoofx/SharpRazor) A simple wrapper around the templating Razor Engine 
- [SharpDiff](https://github.com/xoofx/SharpDiff) A diff library for .NET with added support for a diff3 on .NET objects (this is a fork)

I developed also some older projects on codeplex that are no longer updated:

- [NShader](https://nshader.codeplex.com/) A HLSL/GLSL syntax highlighter for Visual Studio 
- [AsmHighlighter](https://asmhighlighter.codeplex.com/) A ASM x86 syntax highlighter for Visual Studio
- [NetAsm](https://netasm.codeplex.com/) An attempt to hack the JIT of the .NET CLR to inject ASM instructions directly from method attributes
- [NKnobMan](https://nknobman.codeplex.com/) An extension to [Knobman](http://www.g200kg.com/en/software/knobman.html)   
- [NRenoiseTools](https://nrenoisetools.codeplex.com/) A Renoise file exporter to MIDI 

I have also contributed to some open source projects:

- [NAudio](https://naudio.codeplex.com/) A popular Audio framework for .NET
