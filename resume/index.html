<p><em><strong>April 1999 - September 2002 (3.5 years)</strong></em><br />
Team Size: <em>5-8</em></p>
<p>Started as a prototype in a project where the code was mostly a large C/C++ application handling the Profit&amp;Loss, Risk Analysis for the Equity derivatives. The goal of the project was to provide a distributed data system on top of an existing central database, to allow local and faster data access to different applications. The service had to run 24h/365 and was deployed around the world (Paris, NY, London, Tokyo). I have received feedback that this system was still in production in 2015.</p>
<ul>
<li>Early prototype of a Java server using Corba as a middleware</li>
<li>Design and development of a system to synchronize the output of the replication of a Sybase database, plugged into an EventBroker to notify asynchronously the Java data server to update their cache (A Sybase representative told me that It was the first time a team was pushing such an advanced technique with their product)</li>
<li>In order to notify the servers with updates, we have evaluated different low level network methods (UDP multicasting) and have opted for Tibco RendezVous as our lightweight network messaging system.</li>
<li>Development of an ActiveX plugin automatically generated from Java code in order to provide a end-user control accessible from Excel. The generator was also able to generate a full HTML/CHM documentation from Java source files. This technology was much more efficient than the existing solutions provided by Sun at this time.</li>
<li>Provide assistance to other applications to use this service.</li>
<li>Management of the project and technical follow-up with the team.</li>

While traveling I was actively writing and updating my website <a href="http://diteoo.com">diteoo.com</a> (In French, it means <em>&quot;Where are you?&quot;</em>)<br />

I joined the french demoscene group IRIS and released 1 intro and 2 demos (<a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=2893">SpaceDepths</a> and the <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=52813">Olympia Demo</a>). As I was living in the country side of France, It was really difficult at this time to get access to relevant technical documentations about how to use the hardware, so I had often to disassemble existing demos to learn from the best coder's techniques. It is also a period where I have written most assembly code in my life.
I composed also many musics on this platform.</p>
